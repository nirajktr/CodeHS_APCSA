## Introduction
This repository contains all my answers and solutions for the CodeHS assignments I submit for the AP Computer Science A (APCSA) course. It serves as a reference and study guide for anyone taking the course.

## AP-CSA
AP Computer Science A is an introductory college-level computer science course. Students cultivate their understanding of coding through analyzing, writing, and testing code as they explore concepts like modularity, variables, and control structures.
